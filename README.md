For Potholes detection | Using Deep Learning | Yolov3 | Android Studio

Automatic detection of potholes by image processing is an important aspect of road maintenance. It is also a difficult problem due to the inhomogeneity of road damage and complicated background in road images. In recent years, methods based on deep convolutional neural networks have been used to address the challenges of road damage detection and classification. throughout this project, we propose the YOLO - Real-Time Object Detection approach to address these challenges.

In this approach, we apply a single neural network to the full image. This network divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.
